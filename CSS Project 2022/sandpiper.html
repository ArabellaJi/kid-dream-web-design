    <h1>Sandpiper Bakery</h1>
    
    <p class="welcome">Sandpiper Bakery Specializes in Handmade Pastries, Cakes, Tarts, Savories and Sweets.</p>
    
    <p>We draw inspiration from French, English and American baking and use traditional pastry techniques to create menus that showcase the best of every season. We work closely with local farms, purveyors and artisans to offer the best selection possible.</p>
   
   <p>We are so grateful and excited to bring Sandpiper to Ipswich and provide for their community.</p>
   
   <h2>About the owners</h2>
   
   <p>For the past two decades <strong>Susanne Clermont</strong> has lovingly devoted her life to refining the art of baking. From Texas to Europe, over to Maine and finally Boston, Susanne has baked in New England for most of this time. Previously, she owned critically acclaimed Canto 6 Bakery in Jamaica Plain. Susanne is madly in love with her family, ice cream, peach pie, Motown, swimming, sailing, oysters, reading cookbooks, and of course, pounding butter for croissants.</p>
   
   <p>Originally from the Cape Ann area, <strong>Molly Friedman</strong> understands what it means to love where you live. After moving away for several years and exploring other parts of the US and Europe, she felt a pull back home and dove head first into getting as much kitchen experience as possible.</p>
